#summary Directions for using command line interface to SVN, commonly used for Linux platforms.

= Introduction =

Directions for using command line interface to SVN, commonly used for Linux platforms. This is useful for getting around things you cannot figure out how to do using the Netbeans/Eclipse UI. Much of the information here was taken from [http://data.agaric.com/subversion-client-ubuntu-anything-tortoisesvn this page].

= Details =
== Client Installation ==
If "which svn" returns nothing or not found, install the Subversion command line client.
{{{
apt-get install subversion
}}}
== Common Commands ==
In Subversion parlance, "checkout" means to make a copy of the repository on the local filesystem. "Commit" means to push a modification up to the repository.
{{{
svn checkout https://server.example.com/srv/svn/agaric myworkingcopyfolder
svn status
svn update
svn add yournewfilehere
svn add yournewdirectoryincludingfiles/
svn commit -m "I made changes.  Woohoo."
}}}
== Common Scenarios ==
=== Copy a local project into the repository ===
 # Create a local copy of the repository.
{{{
svn checkout https://rtr-team-robotics.googlecode.com/svn/ rtr-team-robotics --username barnaclekarl@gmail.com
}}}
 # Change directory to the playground.
{{{
cd ~/RTR-SVN/rtr-team-robotics/rtr2015/playground
}}}
 # Copy your project to the playground.
{{{
cp -r ~/eclipse_workspace/HelloWorld/ .
}}}
 # Add your project to the repository
{{{
svn add HelloWorld/
}}}
 # Commit the project to the repository
{{{
svn commit HelloWorld --username barnaclekarl@gmail.com
}}}
