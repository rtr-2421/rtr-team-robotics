#Meeting notes from November 4

= Introduction =

At today's meeting Mr. Wilstatter challenged the team to break into two groups and get a robot set up to drive two motors, a drive system. Neither team succeeded. But never say die.

= Team Neptune =
Mr. Liebert uploaded to the repository a _very_ simple robot that might oughtta work to make a 2-stick tank drive. It does not use the Command classes. This is not an example of robot code structure to follow, but it significantly simplifies getting a drive system going.
